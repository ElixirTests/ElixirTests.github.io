                            We are an art focused project mainly driven by our community. So our roadmap is a set of
                            loose ideas. Possible future projects that we are flexible enough to alter if you all
                            desire.

                            Too often projects overpromise and wildly underdeliver. We won't make that same mistake.

                                The Elixir is an art focused NFT project. Too often projects neglect what we see as
                                the
                                most fundamental aspect of any character based
                                NFT project: the art. With Elixir, we haven't made that same mistake. Art has been
                                our
                                foremost priority and we've spent many months ensuring that
                                every detail is perfect. We can't wait for you to see your character and we are
                                confident you will fall in love with the illustration.

                                <br>
                                With so many NFT projects out there (many of which are lazy derivatives of others)
                                we
                                want our project to be unique. This means unique art and a unique roadmap instead of
                                the
                                generic cookie cutter steps that so many NFT projects stick to. We also don’t like
                                when
                                projects stuff their roadmap with easy to complete tasks just to say they have a
                                roadmap
                                and they’ve ticked off some of the boxes. If we pursue something we want it to be of
                                value to you all and we promise that our roadmap will only consists of ideas that we
                                truly believe are worthwhile to pursue.

                                We are brimming with ideas and so excited to set out on this voyage with you all.
                                But we
                                know that together you all can help guide this journey and we value your insights.
                                Ultiamtely, we want you all to determine our next steps suggesting ideas you’d like
                                to
                                see us pursue and giving us feedback on our current plans. And so, we want our
                                roadmap
                                to be viewed as a set of loose ideas. Possible future projects that we are flexible

                                opportunity to use our platform and reach to help other talented creators show off their
                                work.

                                The mythos of elixir is still shrouded in mystery. We’ve unveiled the first drops but we
                                want you all to help us unravel the rest. We will host monthly story writing contests
                                for elixir holders where anyone inclined can help write up the next stage of Elixir's
                                mythos. The community will then decide which contribution they would like to see
                                codified as the next part of Elixir’s mythos and it will subsequently be added to the
                                mythos section on our website (of course acknowledging the winner as the contributor).

                                These competitions only work if they allow community members to vote. So we will be
                                using the elixir website to host these competitions where community members can connect
                                with their wallet containing an Elixir NFT and easily vote in the monthly competitions.
                                We believe this will further foster community and encourage our creators to share their
                                work with like-minded peers.

                                As we have emphasized, we really value you all. And so we want you to be rewarded for
                                your talent, skills and ideas. In addition to hosting these monthly art, and story
                                writing contests which add to the vibrancy off the elixir community and narrative we
                                also will explore creating some mechanism for the participants in these competitions to
                                receive tips from fellow community members who value their contributions. This would
                                likely look like a separate page on the elixir website featuring the past winners and
                                other participants and some built in easy to use mechanism that allows everyone to tip
                                their favorite creators.

                                Maybe…. we’re not sure of course. This would be a big endeavor and would depend on you
                                all and the support we receive but we may explore building a 2.0 collection. The
                                characters that make up the 2.0 collection would be unique in some aspect (Male and
                                female? Unique environments?) where existing Elixir holders get 1 NFT for free. We would
                                build this 2.0 collection in collaboration with you all, shaping the project based on
                                the ideas and feedback you share.

                                As you can tell, however, the distant future for Elixir is still up in the air. We want
                                to do what you as a community value and so we hope that you all can help guide our
                                future. We are excited to hear your voices which we are confident will push us in the
                                perfect direction long term.
